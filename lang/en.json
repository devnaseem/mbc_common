Each item is measured on a 4-point scale, where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents the loss of ability to perform that function. Total scores range from 0 to 24 points, with a higher score showing more severe gMG. \n\n Use the MG-ADL scales on this app to track your symptoms regularly. If you track them weekly, try to do it at the same time every week for consistency. Your Nurse Case Manager will receive this information and may share this with your Neurologist as it may help them detemine your next treatment cycle. This assessment lets you be your own advocate. Knowing what your symptoms are every week may help your doctor help you.",
